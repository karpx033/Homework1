Commented out the footer on the html after clarification that the footer did not need to be shown as it is not in the reference image
Commented out the class changes to .benefit(-lead/-brand/-cost) img. on the css file, picking up where I left off yesterday. Those attributes got moved to a the 'benefits' class
Commented out the assiating classes on the html
Commented out "social-media-marketing" class on the html
Commented out class="social-media-marketing"
Commented out <div id="social-media-marketing"> as that was also unnecessary
Commented out <div id="online-reputation-management"> as that was also unnecessary
Commented out <div class="search-engine-optimization"> as it was no longer used in css
Commented out <div class="header"> as it was unnecessary
Commented out ".sidebar" and ".sidebar img" as they were no longer being used.
Double checked that both the html and css files were now only using the classes "seo, hero, content, float-left, float-right, and benefits" and that all were responsible for doing something
Removed then readded class .blurb after the page broke. Investigating issue there.
Found .blurb using the inspect tool on the browser. <div id="search-engine-optimization" class="blurb"> seems to be remaining, but I am unsure why as it is not in my html file. The page needs .blurb to function correctly so I'll leave it as is.
That finishes confirming that all the classes in the css file are being used.
